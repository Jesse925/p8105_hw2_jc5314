# Problem 1

Read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet:

1. specify the sheet in the Excel file and to omit non-data entries (rows with notes / figures; columns containing notes) using arguments in read_excel
2. use reasonable variable names
3. omit rows that do not include dumpster-specific data
4. round the number of sports balls to the nearest integer and converts the result to an integer variable (using as.integer)

### Read in the Mr. Trash Wheel sheet from the Excel file and clean the data: 

Load nessary libraries for this project:

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
```

Read in the data and do the clean:

```{r}
file_path = 'data/HealthyHarborWaterWheelTotals2018-7-28.xlsx'

trash_wheel_data = 
  read_excel(file_path, sheet = 'Mr. Trash Wheel', skip = 1, range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(dumpster)
```
